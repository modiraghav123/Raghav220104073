why do i want to conyribute to open source?
Recently i heard about Gsoc and then I came to know that we can contribute to the projects around the world through open souce using github.
This is the way by which we can add improvements to the softwares around and make them more uder friendly and rectify its errors.
It also help programmers to get immediate response on their task rather than late works.
